# f1-stats-web-app
This app is an ongoing personal project, with the main aim of practicing data visualisation.

Using the Formula 1 statistics API at ergast.com, the aim is to display Grand Prix data so it is easy to understand.

Currently it uses High-charts to show the data, but in the future I plan to use d3.js/WebVR/WebXR, and also experiment with mongoDB charts.

To run locally from the command line:
~npm install
~npm run build
~npm start

Open a new browser window with the address http://localhost:3000
